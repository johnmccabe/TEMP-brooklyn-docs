## What is Brooklyn?

Brooklyn is a unified framework that allows you to deploy and managed
distributed, multi-cloud, multi-paas applications.

Brooklyn aims to give DevOps practitioners a method for describing deployment configuration and management behavior in a single, concise descriptor.

Even better, the descriptor is executable, causing deployment to occur and
the management to be instantiated.

Two immediate benefts are:

*	The management policies have access to all deployment information (topology & locations), launch mechanisms, and any relevant monitoring information or operations.

	This allows better automated decision making about a running application and thus better performance
	
*	The "run book" for launching an application is recorded as code, which can be tracked and version controlled as an integral part of the application, improving deployment consistency and operator productivity.

## Getting Started

See the [developer's walkthrough](walkthrough.html) for a quick tour,
then dive in to the [user guide](/use/guide/) describing the 
[concepts](/use/guide/defining-applications/basic-concepts.md)
and giving some [tutorial examples](/use/examples/index.html).

Alternatively jump straight in to the [/develop/code](/use/code.html), 
or other [documentation](docs-summary.html).
