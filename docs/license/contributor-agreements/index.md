The Brooklyn project requires the appropriate permission to include and redistribute any contributions
as part of Brooklyn, in order to protect the project and its users.

### Individual CLA

All contributors need to complete and sign the **Individual Contributor License Agreement**.
This can be done easily online:

* [Echosign the Individual CLA](individual.html)

*Note that [Echosign](individual.html) will display a "Name" box which looks like a field
and may be tempting to fill out, but you cannot. You will be prompted for your name later
when you "sign" the form.* 

The raw text of the agreement can be downloaded [here](brooklyn-icla.txt). 

Additionally, if your work is done in a context where any organization may have rights to the contribution,
such as if you are working for a company, someone authorized by the company must
also file a **Corporate Contributor License Agreement** designating you by name.

### Corporate CLA

An authorized representative of a company or organization which wishes to contribute to Brooklyn must file
the **Corporate Contributor License Agreement** and update this as there are changes to the set of employees designated to make contributions.
These actions can also be done online:

* [Echosign the Corporate CLA](corporate.html)
* [Echosign a Schedule A (Designated Employees) Update agreement](corporate-update-schedule.html)

The raw text of the CCLA agreement can be downloaded [here](brooklyn-ccla.txt).
