                Apache Brooklyn is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the 
                Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
                infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
                successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of
                the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
                Apache Brooklyn is distributed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License v2.0</a>.
