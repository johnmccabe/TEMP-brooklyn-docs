This example shows how to build a multi-site web application *fabric*
with DNS configured on the front-end to combine the sites.

It can combine with the [Simple Web Cluster](../webcluster) example
or the [Portable Cloud Foundry](../portable-cloudfoundry) example,
but does not assume knowledge of either of these.

The project ``examples/global-web-fabric`` contains the code used 
in this example in ``src/main/java``.
