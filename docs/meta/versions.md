Brooklyn is still in pre-release, 
currently at snapshot version v{% readj /fields/current-snapshot-version.txt %}.

A GA release for 0.4.0 will be coming soon (in May)
once we have feedback (and have resolved a snapshot dependency).

This section will contain information on the current GA release 
as well as access to snapshot and archived releases.
