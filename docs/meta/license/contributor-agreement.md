We require the appropriate permission to include and redistribute any contributions
as part of Brooklyn, in order to protect ourselves and our users.

You will need to complete, sign, and return the appropriate agreement below:

1. [Echosign](TODO) the Individual Contributor License Agreement:
   this is needed for all contributors
   ([text here](brooklyn-icla.txt))
    
2. Additionally, if your work is done in a context where any organization may have rights to the contribution
   (such as if you are working for a company), someone authorized by the company has to
   [Echosign](TODO) the Corporate Contributor License Agreement ([text here](brooklyn-ccla.txt))

These can also be printed, signed, and mailed to the project at:
