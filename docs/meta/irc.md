IRC is a basic group chat system used by many open source projects to enable developers to 
collaborate and to help users communicate and support each other. Brooklyn has an IRC 
channel where users and developers hang out.

## Getting Help On IRC

When you connect to the Brooklyn IRC channel, say Hi and then ask your question. It may 
take a little while for someone to see and respond to your question. (Be 
patient if you don't get an instant answer - unless there's already a conversation 
happening folk will probably not have their eyes on the channel.) 

You may want to do other things while you wait, like reviewing the [brooklyn mailing list](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-brooklyn-dev/)
lists to see if anyone has had the same issue before.
