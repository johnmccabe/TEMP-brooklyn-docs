## Entities

* WebApp PaaS:  CloudFoundry, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google AppEngine (OpenShift a good starting point)
* Non-Java webapps:  PHP, Rails, Node.js, perl
* CDN:  AWS Cloudfront, Akamai, others
* Data:  _lots!_, including MySQL, Mongo, Couch, etc (look at building on Whirr support, like Hadoop does!)

## Features

* Bind to existing entities on restart
* Extract data from entities that are being stopped, to restore on restart
* Windows:  support running from windows (untested); work on installation _to_ Windows servers
