TODO

*     normal -- should run quickly, not need internet, and not side effect the machine (apart from a few /tmp files)          
*     integration -- deploys locally, may read and write from internet, takes longer
          if you change an entity, rerun the relevant integration test to make sure all is well!
*     live -- deploys remotely, may provision machines (but should clean them up)
