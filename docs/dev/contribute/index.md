If you've built something which you think others could use, or are interested in doing so -- 
whether a new supported entity, or a policy, or an example --
it's easy to give back to the community.  Just:

* Tell everyone at [brooklyn-dev@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/brooklyn-dev) about your intention
* Fork the project on Github
* Clone it, work on it, push, and tell everyone about it
* Sign a contributor agreement
* Issue a pull request from your github repo

The same process holds for this documentation,
but note that [this information](docs.html) may make
your life easier working with our documentation.
