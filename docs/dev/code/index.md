The code is on [github](http://github.com/cloudsoft/brooklyn).  Check it out using:

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git@github.com:cloudsoft/brooklyn.git
{% endhighlight %}

The **examples** project is a good starting point. 

Some summary of the project structure and architecture is currently
kept on the [wiki](http://github.com/cloudsoft/brooklyn/wiki);
and where things aren't documented please ask at 
[brooklyn-dev@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/brooklyn-dev)
so that can be remedied!
