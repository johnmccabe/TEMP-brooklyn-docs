If you've built something which you think others could use, or are interested in doing so -- 
whether a new supported entity, or a policy, or an example --
it's easy to give back to the community.  Just:

* Tell [brooklyn-dev@googlegroups.com](http://groups.google.com/group/brooklyn-dev) about your work or interest
* Create your fork of the project on GitHub
* Clone it to your local machine and do your work on it -- , push, and tell everyone about it
* Sign a contributor agreement
* Issue a pull request from your GitHub repo

The same process holds for contributing to this documentation (web site and user guide),
but see the additional [tips for updating documentation]({{ site.url }}/dev/tips/update-docs.html).

### Some Words of Advice

TODO

     dev work goes to sandbox, partial work can be pulled if of acceptable quality
          (keep branches short-lived)
          
     new entity to main may need update to 
          /pom.xml modules
          all-software-and-systems/pom.xml dependencies
          
     new examples needs update to /pom.xml and /examples/pom.xml; you may want to update the documentation too
     
     include javadoc and tests

     if you get blocked, hollar!
