This is redundant with versions page.  Link to versions page?  List more things including other docs?
Basically make this page pretty...

## Official User Guide

Our main user manual is organised by release version. Please pick the version that you are using:

- [{{ site.brooklyn-stable-version }}]({{ site.path.v }}/latest) -
  This is the latest stable version.

- [0.7.0-M1]({{ site.path.v }}/0.7.0-M1) -
  Please note that this release was made prior to entering the Apache Incubator,
  and therefore it is not endorsed by Apache.

From the links above you can also access the Developer Guide for the relevant versions.

## Other Docs

Many other mini-docs are available [here](other-docs.html).
