Hello developers! These pages are aimed at people who want to get involved with reading, changing, testing and otherwise
working with the "bleeding edge" of code produced by our project.

These pages contain information about accessing the "bleeding edge" code, and artifacts produced from it. Such code and
artifacts have not been formally released, and therefore The Apache Software Foundation has not performed any validation
or due diligence. They may contain bugs which cause data loss and other serious consequences. Proceed only if you
understand the potential consequences of using unreleased, untested code.
