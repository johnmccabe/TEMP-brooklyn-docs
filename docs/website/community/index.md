## Mailing lists

Our main discussion list is our *dev* list - here you can ask questions and get
help with issues, ranging from basic getting started through to detailed
questions about Brooklyn's internals.

To subscribe, send an email to:
[dev-subscribe@brooklyn.incubator.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@brooklyn.incubator.apache.org)

You can also [read and search the dev list
archives](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-brooklyn-dev/) on
Apache's list archiver.


### Other lists

We also have a *commits* list - a read-only list which automatically posts as
commits are made to our source repositories. Subscribe by sending an email to
[commits-subscribe@brooklyn.incubator.apache.org](mailto:commits-subscribe@brooklyn.incubator.apache.org),
and [read the archives here](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-brooklyn-commits/).


### Historical lists

Before Brooklyn joined the Apache Incubator, we had lists hosted on Google
Groups. These lists are now deprecated and it's no longer possible to subscribe
or post, but you may find useful information in the archives.

- [Old Brooklyn users list archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brooklyn-dev)
- [Old Brooklyn dev list archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brooklyn-dev)

Once again, these lists are deprecated, so please subscribe to the Apache-hosted
lists to receive new messages.

## Issue tracker

We have a [Jira instance at Apache](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BROOKLYN)


## Contributing source code

If you have changes or additions to the Brooklyn source code, we would love to
see them! Please read our guide on [how to contribute](how-to-contribute.html).

If you have used the *brooklyncentral* repository prior to Brooklyn's move to
Apache, you can read the guide on
[how to migrate your brooklyncentral fork to Apache](migrate-to-apache.html).

Committers can read the corresponding [guide for committers](committers.html)
to see how to review and merge contributions.


## Contributing to the website and documentation

We would also be very happy to receive contributions to our website and
documentation. You can read our [How to contribute
documentation](how-to-contribute-docs.html) guide or, if you are impatient,
simply click on the *Edit this page* button at the bottom of most pages on this
site and follow the instructions.


## IRC

Join channel `#brooklyncentral` on the [Freenode](https://freenode.net/) IRC
network. Many of the Brooklyn dev team can be found here. Note that the team
is predominantly Europe-based, and channel activity is usually centered
around European daylight hours.
