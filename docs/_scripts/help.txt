to make the docs LIVE, you need to build.sh then copy in to the gh-pages branch
(suggest making a separate repo for that, keeping it in the gh-pages branch)

here are some draft scripts for how to do it,
assuming we have a "staging" area for snapshot builds

export TARGET=/path/to/other/repo/
export BV=0.4.0-SNAPSHOT   # BROOKLYN_VERSION

_scripts/build.sh
rm -rf $TARGET/v/$BV
mkdir $TARGET/v/$BV
cp -r _site/* $TARGET/v/$BV/

# and push
pushd $TARGET
git add -A .
git commit -m "updated version docs for version $BV"
git push
popd


(note the whole thing is mounted under /brooklyn at cloudsoft.github.com
currently, hence the refs to /brooklyn in _config.yml and various scripts)

when we do a RELEASE we'll run the above for e.g. BV=0.4.0
AND update the files in the root dir as well, with a process below 
(kinda like the process above but with / in place of /v/$BV
and overriding url in _config.yml with the --url arg below):

pushd $TARGET
for x in * ; do if [[ $x != "v" ]] ; then rm -rf $x ; fi ; done
popd


_scripts/build.sh --url /brooklyn
cp -r _site/* $TARGET/

pushd $TARGET
git add -A .
git commit -m "updated root docs for version $BV"
git push
popd
