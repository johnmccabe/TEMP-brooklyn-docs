to make the docs live, you need to build.sh then copy in to the gh-pages branch
(suggest making a separate repo for that, keeping it in the gh-pages branch)

ideally we'd like it versioned (so we can see v0.x docs), 
but there are issues with links in the pages being to the root
so it won't maintain a version atm, but if we can resolve that
then i'd advocate a process like this:

export TARGET=/path/to/other/repo/
export BV=0.4.0-SNAPSHOT   # BROOKLYN_VERSION

_scripts/build.sh
rm -rf $TARGET/v/$BV
mkdir $TARGET/v/$BV
cp -r _site/* $TARGET/v/$BV/

# and push
pushd $TARGET
git add -A .
git commit -m "updated docs for version $BV"
popd



(when we do a release we'll update the main as well, e.g.
pushd $TARGET
for x in * ; do if [[ $x != "v" ]] ; then rm -rf $x ; fi
cp -r v/$BV/* .
popd

and have to figure out a way for paths to indicate whether they are versioned or latest release)
